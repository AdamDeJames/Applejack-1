TODO List:

Change from GLON to JSON.
Re-Write SQL, make it faster.
Make SQL Change each query, not every 5 seconds.
New F1 menu.
Fix some bugs. (Like, if someones name is nobody, they can't buy doors).
Make ULX work with gamemode.
Custom admin addons? (Edit inventory, etc)
Better documentation for gamemode. (Commands, functions, hooks etc)
Lower cave slaying on rp_evocity_v2d. Currently slays them if they go past the paintball field.

KNOWN BUGS:
If your name is nobody ingame, you can't buy doors. (It sets the door owner to nobody in the base code...)
ULX Stops the player from spawning due to it overwriting hooks.
